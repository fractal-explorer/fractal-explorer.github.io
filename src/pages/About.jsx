                    <p> Fractals are recursively-generated, infinitely self similar patterns; if you zoom into part of it, you will get a replica of the zoomed-out image, and this can go on forever. The most notable example is the mandelbrot set, which shows how a simple mathematical equation can create complex and beautiful patterns. [elaborate on how the project works]</p>

                    <h2> How </h2>
                    <p> This project was constructed in Unity and can be experienced via an Oculus VR headset. We used Spotifyâ€™s API to access various audio traits of the songs, and C# scripts to modify the fractals themselves. [elaborate on technical implementation]</p>
