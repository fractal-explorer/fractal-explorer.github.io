                    <h2> What </h2>
                    <p> 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Fractals</a> are recursively-generated, infinitely self similar patterns; if you zoom into part of it, you will get a replica of the zoomed-out image that goes on infinitely, showing how a simple mathematical equation can create complex and beautiful patterns. 
                        Fractal Explorer utilizes elements of algorithmic art and digital morphogenesis, such as iteration and recursion, to create a three-dimensional fractal that changes in color, shape, speed, etc. based on the audio features (e.g. tempo, energy, valence) of a song of the user's choosing.

                    <h2> Why </h2>
                    <p> 
                    We wanted a theme that combined our interests in math, art, music, and psychology. 
                    Fractals are constructed using simple rules but can create complex and beautiful patterns, so we chose it as our theme because tweaking a few parameters in the code can quickly and completely change the fractal. 
                    We were inspired by visual representations of fractals like the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set#Examples">Julia</a> set, as well as works like Electric Sheep that utilize color and music to invoke emotions. 
                    But, in order to make the experience more immersive, we did ours in 3D instead of 2D.

                    <h2> How </h2>
                    <p> This project was constructed in Unity and can be experienced via an Oculus headset. 
                    We used Spotifyâ€™s API to access various audio traits of the songs and modeled the GameObjects in Maya. 
                    We developed C# functions to recursively generate GameObjects and modularly control various features of the fractal (color, speed, shape, etc), using public variables for the parameters so that they could easily be altered </p>
