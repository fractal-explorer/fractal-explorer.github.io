                <p> Hi I’m Katherine, I’m an undergraduate college student double majoring in Computer Science and Immersive Media Design (Computing). I aspire to synthesize technology and creativity to create innovative works whilst expanding my technical skillset, so I'm super excited about this project because I got the chance to work with virtual reality and show the power programming and algorithms can have in art.<br />

                <p> Hey I’m Chloe, I’m super excited to be working on this project because I have a passion for both music, emotions, and of course VR. I think it’ll be cool to see the fractal environment interact with physical human emotions as we play around with shape, size, speed, color, intensity and more within the virtual world. I have never done anything like this except for a robot that changed shape based on musical input, however this was within the physical world. Time to get virtual!</p>

                <p>Hi I’m Camryn, and I am currently pursuing a dual degree in Psychology and Immersive Media Design. I am thrilled to work on a project that is both technologically robust but also visually appealing. It gave me the opportunity to combine my strengths in psychology with design and IMD by creating an environment that syncs fractals shape, speed, and color based on the song playing. <br />
