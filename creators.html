                <p> Hi I’m Katherine, I’m a college student studying Computer Science and Immersive Media Design. My goal is to synthesize technology and creativity to create innovative works, so I'm super excited about this project because it shows the power programming can have in art, in virtual reality!<br />

                <p> Hey I’m Chloe, I’m super excited to be working on this project because I have a passion for both music, emotions, and of course VR. I think it’ll be cool to see the fractal environment interact with physical human emotions as we play around with shape, size, speed, color, intensity and more within the virtual world. I have never done anything like this except for a robot that changed shape based on musical input, however this was within the physical world. Time to get virtual!</p>
